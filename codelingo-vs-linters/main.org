* Making tenets with CLQL that do the job of existing linters
I started learning Go and CodeLingo / CLQL at the same time, so while I have found it generally easy and straightforward to create these tenets, I feel like I could've knocked them out even faster if I didn't need to look up answers to questions such as '/what is an interface in golang?/', for example. The process has been intuitive; I think in part to having a good naming convention. I've had to learn what CodeLingo is, what a '*tenet*' and a '*flow*' is. Long story short, they are just as what they sound like they are.

** Defintions taken from the project docs
+ tenet :: A Tenet is an /encoded/ project-specific _best practice_ used to guide development.

           (an */encoded/ _best practice_*)

+ flow :: A Flow is an /automated/ development _workflow_ that leverages Tenets to do some task, for example automating code reviews.

          (an */automated/ _workflow_*)

** The general process of writing one tenet
The process of crafting CLQL is mainly subtractive, especially for simple tenets.
What is simple to implement in CodeLingo may be difficult for 3rd party linters, however, as this write-up should demonstrate.
Writing a tenet to describe an antipattern might be trivial in CLQL, but the corresponding linter may be /*orders*/ of magnitude more complex.

*** Writing the CLQL
**** The *first* step is usually to generate a verbose CLQL query from the CodeLingo playground.
To do this you select the part of the code you would like to match and then click the _generate_[fn:gen] button.

**** The *next* step is to trefine that query into something that captures the logic of what you want a tenet to match.
Typically, the generated query comprises the bulk of the code you end up with.  You can therefore choose what to leave in, or add new logic, depending on the needs of the tenet.

*** Writing the unit test
**** Obtaining test code for the ~example.go~ file
I found *'Go by example'*[fn:gobyexample] a good place to both learn Go and to obtain test code for tenets.
CodeLingo test code just looks like regular code, except it should contain the thing that the tenet is looking for, and that is usually an anti-pattern. Therefore, this is where you put deliberately bad code.

[fn:gobyexample]  [[https://gobyexample.com/interfaces][Go by Example: Interfaces]]


**** Generating JSON for the "Expected results" file, ~expected.json~
After a review on the CLI, a JSON file is presented. You can just copy and paste this JSON code into a file called ~expected.json~.

** Making a new tenet named 'init'
*** I started by visiting the _[[https://www.codelingo.io/playground/?lang=go][CodeLingo Playground]]_

A good way to start is by generating some CLQL for the thing you would like to match.

**** Step 1: *Generate* some CLQL

***** Write an init function into the _Source Code: Go"_ section

#+BEGIN_SRC go
  package code // you also need to say it's part of a package

  func init() {
  }
#+END_SRC

***** Double tap on 'init' to select it.

***** Click on _Generate Query_ and copy the resulting CLQL code

****** This is what the button looks like.
[[file:generate.png]]

****** This is what the generated CLQL looks like.

 #+BEGIN_SRC yaml
   import codelingo/ast/go

   go.file(depth = any):
     go.decls:
       @playground.highlight
       go.func_decl:
         go.ident:
           child_count == 0
           name == "init"
           private == "true"
           public == "false"
         go.func_type:
           go.field_list:
             child_count == 0
 #+END_SRC

 + total clicks :: The number of times needed to press _generate query_

 | total clicks | purpose                                              |
 |--------------+------------------------------------------------------|
 |            1 | to generate a query that matches an init() function  |

**** Step 2: *Refine* the CLQL

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
  import codelingo/ast/go

  go.file(depth = any):
    go.decls:
      go.func_decl:
        @ review.comment
        go.ident:
          name == "init"
        go.func_type:
          go.field_list:
            child_count == 0
#+END_SRC

***** Actions
- Remove ~@playground.highlight~
- Add ~@ review.comment~
- Remove things that are not relevant to our query.

  - The first ~child_count~ was taken out because we can see that a function definition (~go.func_decl~) with identifier name equal to "init" (~go.ident:~ ~name == "init"~) is enough to describe a function with name "init".

  - The second ~child_count~ was left in because we'd like to match "init" functions that do not take any parameters.
    #+BEGIN_SRC yaml
      child_count == 0
    #+END_SRC

  - The visibility assertions in this case are not neccessary. Usually we want the tenet to be able to generalise.
    #+BEGIN_SRC yaml
      private == "true"
      public == "false"
    #+END_SRC

***** This is the diff of the refinement we made to the CLQL
#+BEGIN_SRC diff
  5d4
  <     @playground.highlight
  6a6
  >       @ review.comment
  8d7
  <         child_count == 0
  10,11d8
  <         private == "true"
  <         public == "false"
#+END_SRC

*** The tenet
After indenting with 6 spaces (3 indents), I copied the CLQL into the ~query:~ section of a new ~codelingo.yaml~ file.
The ~codelingo.yaml~ file is the file you might simply call the '*tenet*'.

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
  tenets:
    - name: init
      doc: |
        Check that no inits functions are present in Go code.
      flows:
        codelingo/review:
          comment: Init functions cause an import to have a side effects, and side effects are hard to test, reduce readability and increase the complexity of code.
      query: |
        import codelingo/ast/go

        go.file(depth = any):
          go.decls:
            go.func_decl:
              @ review.comment
              go.ident:
                name == "init"
              go.func_type:
                go.field_list:
                  child_count == 0
#+END_SRC

There are 3 more files that typically go into making a full-featured tenet.

**** DONE

**** Generate some CLQL
***** Write the antipattern into the _Source Code: Go"_ section
We dont want to use the ~float64()~ type-conversion function on a variable we already know is a float.
Honestly, this wasn't hard to write.

*** Caveats
**** unconvert
- This linter did not have any unit tests that I could use in the creation of the tenet.

  I ran the original linter on a repository to find an example of what to put into a unit test.


[fn:tests] The number of times I had to *test* the tenet.


[fn:approx] These are approximations.


[fn:gen] This is what the button looks like.

** Conclusions
Even though the ~bool-param~ tenet was already made by blake, it took no longer than 10 minutes for myself, a total newbie, to make.

What's even more astonishing is our queries are functionally equivalent and that /CLQL/ is clever enough to do what we both mean with regards to the position of the comment, even though we had specified the location of the ~@ review.comment~ in different places.


[fn:tests] The number of times I had to run the tests, to make sure the unit tests were satisfactory.


[fn:approx] These are approximations.

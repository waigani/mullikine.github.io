        title: Interface Has Too Many Methods
        body: |
          Awesome interfaces are small. >4 methods is a code smell. Split out large interfaces into semantically grouped methods.
      codelingo/review:
        comment: This interface has more than 4 methods. Consider splitting this interface up according to semantically grouped methods.

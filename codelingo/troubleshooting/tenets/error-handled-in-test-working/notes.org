* Create a tenet that finds error codes which are not handled in ~_test.go~ files

** Completed tenet that is blocked
https://github.com/mullikine/codelingo/blob/lightning-network-daemon/tenets/codelingo/lightning-network-daemon/error-handled-in-test/codelingo.yaml

*** Review comment
This error code is not handled within any "_test.go" that can be seen. Consider writing a test which handles this code.

*** tenet-building process
**** DONE write first query
Need to find all err that are returned by functions
All function definitions that define error as one of the return parameters

https://mullikine.github.io/codelingo/troubleshooting/tenets/error-handled-in-test-working/refined-def.clql

**** DONE write second query
ensure that variable 'err' is tested in a binary_expr within a _test
file and is connected somehow with the above

https://mullikine.github.io/codelingo/troubleshooting/tenets/error-handled-in-test-working/refined-test.clql

**** DONE tie the two queries together by being under the same directory
https://mullikine.github.io/codelingo/troubleshooting/tenets/error-handled-in-test-working/combined.clql

***** This is a better reference for completed tenet than combined.clql

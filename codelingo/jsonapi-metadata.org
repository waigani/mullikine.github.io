* Question on slack
Hey guys. Sorry for asking again, but it's a little bit urgent for me to get to the bottom of this. According to https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/scalability-good-practices.md

snippet:

Every object kind MUST have the following metadata in a nested object field called "metadata":

-  namespace:
-  name:
-  uid:

Could someone please give me an example of what an 'object kind is' and where these fields are populated?

I'm writing a linter specially for the kubernetes project; I don't need to actually extend the code myself so not looking to understand how it all works. I just need to know where to look. An example would be great. Thanks!

  Question:
    i cant find any files which match all 3 terms. so i dont know how to make even a basic linter
  Answer:
    the reason is that the UID is assigned after creation.
    you typically only submit a namespace and name of an object. then kubernetes itself assigns a uid dynamically after the object is created.
